This README file contains answers to homework 3.    

1. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data.  
2. The 3 major applications/roles are: a) a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction (predictive computing).     
                                       b) a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available (numerical simulation).    
                                       c) a substitute for theory, where it is not available (data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning, â€¦).  
3. Deductive and Plausible Reasoning.  
4. We say that rain occurs due to the formation of clouds or that before rain occurs clouds are formed which is a logical implication, but the formation of clouds does not   
   guarantee the occurence of rain which is a physical causation.  
5. The policeman deduced that he is a robber through the following reasoning:  
    1. If a burglar alarm is heard, there's a possibility of robbery.  
    2. If the window of the jewelry store is broken, then there's a burglary happening or has happened.
    3. If a person crawls out the broken window, the burglary is currently happening and the person may be the robber.
    4. If the person is carrying a bag full of jewels/stolen items, then he is the robber.
    5. Hence, if a person is seen carrying a bag full of jewels/stolen items and is seen crawling out of a broken window of the jewelry store who's burglar alarm went off,          then that person is the robber and is currently robbing the store.  




12. a. bit.  
    b. bit is the smallest because it can only store 2 variables. No I wouldn't be able to, I wouldn not be able to because if im referencing myself in space then I am 
       stationary unless and until I compare myself with another entity. I would need a referene point to my location.  
    c.
