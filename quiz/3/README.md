1. The steps involved in scientific inference are: 1. reality - natural phenomena that we observe, 2. mathematical abstraction - observational data, construction of a model based on the observational data and finally, prediction.  
2. Experiment, Theory, and Computation + Data.  
3. a) a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction (predictive computing).  
   b) a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available (numerical simulation).  
   c) a substitute for theory, where it is not available (data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning, â€¦).
4. Deductive - example:  All dogs bark and Max is dog, therefore Max barks.  
   Plausible - example: if it's raining then it must be cloudy.
5. We say that rain occurs due to the formation of clouds or that before rain occurs clouds are formed which is a logical implication, but the formation of clouds does not
guarantee the occurence of rain which is a physical causation.
6. George Boole.

9. It means that both the propositions (Let's say A and B), have the same truth value; A = B, left hand proposition has the same truth value as the right hand proposition.
