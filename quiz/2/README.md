This README.md file contain answers to quiz 2.  
1. Registers.  
2. Computer memory is comprised of multilevel structure so as to address the speed gap between CPU and memory. The multilevel structure has varying speeds and sizes. The benefit of this hierarchical memory layout is that the CPU can predict and prefetch the future data or instructions from the slower but larger levels of memory hierarchy to the higher levels for subsequent usage by the CPU for computations.  
3. Disk.  
4. Registers < L1 Cache < L2 Cache < L3 Cache < DRAM < Disk.  
5. bit.  
6. Everything is represented by binary (0s and 1s) in computer because its easy to represent them electronically. Anything in binary can be stored in computer memory and processed.  
7. The speed is <ns.  
8. Late 1940s.
9. 1940s.
10. A kind of computer that had to be rewired to perform a new task such as a calculator.
11. Calculator.
12. Declarative knowlegdge involves statements of facts. Imperative Knowledge is about how to accomplish something, a recipe on how to do something, if you will.
13. a. Declarative.
    b. Declarative.
    c. Imperative.
    d. Declarative.
    e. Imperative.
14. Imperative.
15. ENIAC.
16. Python.
17. Fortran.
18. Memory Array, Control Unit, Program Counter, Arithmetic Block, and CPU.  
19. Calculator.  
20. Fortan   
    COBOL  
    B   
    C++  
    Python and Java.
21. (A). Assembly language.
    (B). Yes, it requires and assembler to interpret the code.
22. (A). Fortran.
    (B). 7 decades old, it was invented in 1954.
23. (A). Assembly Language.
    (B). Fortran - third generation, C - third generation, C++ - third generation, MATLAB - fourth generation, Python - fourth generation, R - fourth generation.
24. C - early 1970s, C++ - 1980s, MATLAB - 1970s , Python - 1990s.
25. B
26. C with classes.
27. ABC
28. Logarithm is an exponent or a power raised to a base for example, 2^5 is a logarithm.  
29. S = 84
30. HDD lasts 5 years.
31. 
32. 10^5050. Basically what I did was since the base of each term is same we can add up all the powers and create a single term, I used arithmetic progression to find the sum of all the powers and then I equated the whole equation to 10 raised to 5050.
