Here are the answers to the 2nd homework.  
1. PDF is uploaded.  
2. Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer.  
3. Everything is represented by integers in computer because its easy to represent them electronically. Anything in binary can be stored in coputer memory and processed.  
4. Cache and Registers.  
5. Disk (Hard Disk).  
6. bit is the smallest unit of information.  
7. (A) Assembly Language.  
   (B) No, it does not.  
8. (A) Fortran.  
   (B) Fortran is 7 decades old, it was invented in 1954.  
9. (A) Assembly Language.  
   (B) Fortran - third generation, C - third generation, C++ - third generation, MATLAB - fourth generation, python - fourth generation, R - fourth generation.  
10. C - 1970s, C++ - 1980s, MATLAB - Late 1970s, Python - 1990s.  
11. B.  
12. C with classes.  
13. ABC is ancestor language of Python.  
14. Registers.  
15. bit.  
16. super fast!!  
17. One to two orders of magnitude faster.  
18. Much faster.
19. The primary roles of transistors are to amplify electrical signals and combinations of transistors can build the electronic equivalents of logical operators.
20. When the size of transistors reduced to increase the number of transistors, the transistors stopped working.  
21. The three tasks are: 1. fetch, 2. decode, 3. execute.
22. That is because when the number of transistors are increased by decreasing their size, they start to fail, hence even if the number of CPU cycles are more it is still slower than a computer with less CPU cycles.
23. Memory access is the bottleneck of speed in modern computers.
24. Dennard Scaling/MOFSET Scaling reduces the size of transistors making them energy/power efficient. Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years.
