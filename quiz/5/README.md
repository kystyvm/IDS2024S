1. All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic. We refer to these features as aesthetics. few aesthetics are position, shape, size.
2. Continuous and Discrete.
3. Variables holding qualitative data are called factors and those holding the different categories are called levels.
4. Continuous and Discrete. Continuous - Date, Discrete - (good, fair, poor) qualitative ordered.
5. factors.
6. ordered - good, fair, poor ; unordered - dog, cat, fish.
7. Data of periodic nature.
8. Qualitative color scale - a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different
   manufacturers of a certain product.
   Sequential color scale - Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.
   Diverging color scale - In some cases, we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
   Accent color scales - accent color scales , which are color scales that contain both a set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more saturated colors, Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.
9. Because it makes interpreting the data difficult.
10. random numbers can be termed at numerical but when theyre assigned to some particular thing for example: 1,2,3,4... and I assign a category to them then they become categorical.  
11. Color is categorical /unordered.
12. All of them.
13. The second one.
14. a. San Diego.
    b. Chicago.
    c. Death Valley.
    d. Houston.
15. a. qualitative color scale.
    b. sequential color scale.
    c. diverging color scale.
    d. accent color scale.
16. Accent color scale.
17. Weekend gross scale is too big.
18. excel sheet attached.
19. Temperature of earth will increase.  According to the 1951-1980 average temperature it looks as though the temperature will remain steady at 0 degree celsius.
