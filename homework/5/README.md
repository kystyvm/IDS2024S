11. Qualitative color scale - a means to distinguish discrete items or groups that do not have an intrinsic order, such as different countries on a map or different       
    manufacturers of a certain product.  
    Sequential color scale - Color can also be used to represent data values, such as income, temperature, or speed. In this case, we use a sequential color scale.
    Diverging color scale - In some cases, we need to visualize the deviation of data values in one of two directions relative to a neutral midpoint.
    Accent color scales - accent color scales , which are color scales that contain both a set of subdued colors and a matching set of stronger, darker, and/or more 
    saturated 
    colors, Color can also be an effective tool to highlight specific elements in the data.
